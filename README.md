- 👋 Hi, I’m @carsondenison. Eleven months ago I learned about the existential risks from AI. I immediately quit my job doing computational fluid dynamics to focus entirely on ML. I got a job at Google in the spring and I've been there skilling up since.
- 👀 I’m interested in making large language models safer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI safety research.
- 📫 How to reach me: please feel free to reach out my name at gmail with any questions.
